# QuadratureRules

## A module for multi-dimensional quadrature rules for numerical integration. 

This is a Julia version of the quadrature rule class that can be found in my chaos_basispy package (https://github.com/tsilifis/chaos_basispy3), currently supporting multi-dimensional quadrature rules of the following types: 

- **Gauss-Hermite
- **Gauss-Legendre
- **Gauss-Laguerre
- **Clennshaw-Curtis
- **Newton-Cotes
